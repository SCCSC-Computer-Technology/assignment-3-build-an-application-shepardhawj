To enhance readability I would comment more of the code so that each parts purpose is understood at a glance. Otherwise the code is organized and easy to understand.
The application executed without any compiler issues. The filter for computer jobs didn't execute so I might have just deleted the controls from the form. I think you should have deleted the empty methods in your welcome form code so that they didn't take up space. 
One of the differences in our programs is that you allowed for editing on your state information form. I like that it is available here so it is clear what you are editing and where.

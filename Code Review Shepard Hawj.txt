I like how you load all the states into the combo box from the database. Also, your naming convention for naming buttons and boxes is nice as well. When you search the state it displays a nice way to see all information and edit information all in one location, that is a nice touch. When I edited the information in the search form and closed the form it never updated the stateCombobox and would have liked to see that implemented.

The program did work however i noticed that the data wasn't stored in a database, excel or any 
software form. While the data is accurate and the program does work and meets the requirments from one of
the classes i did hear we were supposed to use some form of a database and implement that into our program. 

With that being told, the program did still work as intended and i enjoyed interacting with it and looking through
the information.
